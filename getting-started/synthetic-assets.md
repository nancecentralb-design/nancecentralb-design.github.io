# ðŸ’Ž Synthetic Assets

## What are Synthetic Assets?

Synthetic assets are financial derivatives that provide exposure to an underlying asset without requiring actual ownership. A synthetic asset is essentially a tokenised derivative that mirrors the value of another asset.

### How Synthetic Assets Work

Synthetic assets allow you to gain price exposure to an asset without holding the asset itself. This is achieved through smart contracts that track the price of the underlying asset and maintain a stable peg through collateralisation.
