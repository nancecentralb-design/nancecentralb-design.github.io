# ðŸ”“ Staking and Locking

### Staking $B4NK

Staking provides flexible access to your tokens while earning platform fees.

#### Benefits

* **No Lockup**: Withdraw your tokens anytime
* **BNB Rewards**: Earn BNB from protocol minting and redemption fees
* **Simple**: Stake and unstake with no penalties

#### Best For

* Users who want flexibility
* Short-term holders
* Those who may need quick access to their B4NK

### Locking B4NK

Locking provides higher rewards in exchange for committing your tokens.

#### Benefits

* **BNB Rewards**: Earn BNB from protocol minting and redemption fees
* **B4NK Rewards**: Additional rewards from early exit penalties
* **Higher APR**: Earn more than staking due to penalty revenue

#### Requirements

* **No Early Exit**: Cannot withdraw before lock period ends

#### Best For

* Long-term believers in the protocol
* Users seeking maximum yield
* Those who don't need immediate liquidity

* Vesting, staking, and locking batch processing
