# üßë‚Äçüåæ Liquidity Mining

## Liquidity Mining (Farms)

Provide liquidity and stake LP tokens to earn B4NK emissions.

### Pool Allocation

<table><thead><tr><th width="350">Pool</th><th>Allocation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>xBNB/BNB LP</strong> (stable/pegged pair)</td><td>70%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>B4NK/BNB LP</strong></td><td>30%</td></tr></tbody></table>

### How Liquidity Mining Works

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Add Liquidity

Provide liquidity to xBNB/BNB or B4NK/BNB pools on PancakeSwap to receive LP tokens.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Stake LP Tokens

Deposit your LP tokens into our farming contracts to start earning B4NK rewards.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Earn B4NK Rewards

Accumulate B4NK emissions based on your share of the pool and the pool's allocation weight.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Claim & Vest

Claimed rewards enter an 8-week vesting period with options for early exit.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Vesting Mechanics

All farm rewards enter an 8-week vesting period after claiming.

#### Vesting Options

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Wait 8 Weeks" %}
**100% Rewards**

Wait the full 8-week vesting period to receive 100% of your earned rewards.

**Benefits:**

* Maximum rewards
* No penalties
* Vesting tokens earn platform fees
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Claim Early" %}
**50% Rewards**

Claim immediately and receive 50% of your rewards. The other 50% is distributed as a penalty.

**Penalty Distribution:**

* 50% goes to locked B4NK holders
* Creates additional yield for long-term stakers
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Important Notes

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Vesting Benefits**

* Vesting tokens count as staked and earn platform fees
* Early claiming incurs 50% penalty
* Claimed rewards must be collected on Farm Page
{% endhint %}

### Maximising Your Returns

#### Strategy Tips

**1. Choose Your Pool**

* xBNB/BNB for stable pair farming with lower IL risk
* B4NK/BNB for higher volatility but direct exposure to protocol token

**2. Consider Vesting Time**

* Full 8 weeks for maximum returns
* Early exit only if opportunity cost is high

**3. Compound Rewards**

* Use platform fee rewards to add more liquidity
* Reinvest claimed B4NK back into pools

**4. Use Zap Features**

* Simplify LP creation with one-click zaps
* Save gas and time with automated processes

### Fees

{% hint style="success" %}
**No Deposit Fees**

There are no deposit fees on any farms. You keep 100% of your LP tokens working for you.
{% endhint %}

However, remember that:

* PancakeSwap charges standard DEX fees (0.25% swap fee)
* There are protocol fees (0.50%) when minting/redeeming xBNB

### Impermanent Loss

#### xBNB/BNB Pool

**Lower IL Risk**: Since xBNB maintains a 1:1000 peg with BNB, this pool experiences minimal impermanent loss, similar to stablecoin pairs.

#### B4NK/BNB Pool

**Standard IL Risk**: This pool has normal impermanent loss risk as B4NK price can fluctuate independently of BNB.
