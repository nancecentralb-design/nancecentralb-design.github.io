**Lower CR = Less BNB needed**

* More B4NK required as collateral
* Cheaper if you already hold B4NK
* Useful when xBNB is above peg

**Higher CR = More BNB needed**

* Less B4NK required as collateral
* Better if you want to minimize B4NK exposure
* Typical when xBNB is under peg

#### For Redeemers

**Lower CR = Less BNB returned**

* More B4NK returned instead
* Less attractive for redemptions
* Incentivises holding xBNB

**Higher CR = More BNB returned**

* Less B4NK returned instead
