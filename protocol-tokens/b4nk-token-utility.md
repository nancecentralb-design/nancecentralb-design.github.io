# B4NK - Token Utility

## B4NK Token Utility

B4NK serves as the protocol utility token on Binance Smart Chain, rewarding holders with **100% of generated protocol fee revenue**.

### Core Functions

<table><thead><tr><th width="180">Function</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Minting</strong></td><td>B4NK tokens are burned when minting xBNB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Redeeming</strong></td><td>B4NK tokens are minted when redeeming xBNB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Governance</strong></td><td>B4NK holders have voting power in Binance Central Bank DAO</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Fee Distribution</strong></td><td>100% of protocol fees distributed to B4NK holders</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Value Capture Mechanisms

#### 1. Fee Distribution

Protocol fees are generated from every minting and redemption transaction:

* **Minting Fee**: 0.50%
* **Redeeming Fee**: 0.50%
* **Distribution**: BNB and B4NK dividends to locked B4NK holders

All fees collected are distributed to users who stake or lock their B4NK tokens, creating a direct value flow from protocol activity to token holders.

#### 2. B4NK Demand & Value Capture

Capital required for xBNB minting creates natural demand for B4NK as collateral requirement.

When users mint xBNB, they need:

* BNB based on the current Collateral Ratio
* B4NK for the remaining portion

This creates constant buying pressure on B4NK tokens as the protocol scales and more xBNB is minted.

#### 3. Future Utility

**New Synthetic Assets**\
As additional synthetic tokens are added to the protocol, B4NK will serve as collateral for all of them, increasing utility and liquidity for B4NK holders.

**DeFi Integrations**\
Future integrations will unlock new trading strategies including derivatives and leveraged farming opportunities.

**Early Exit Penalty Revenue**\
50% of penalty fees from early reward claims are distributed to locked B4NK holders, providing additional income streams.

### Token Economics

**Deflationary Pressure**

B4NK is burned during minting and minted during redemption. In a growing protocol with net positive minting, B4NK experiences deflationary pressure.
